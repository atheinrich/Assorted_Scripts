# Update
Most of everything below is obsolete. I like to use this repository as a personal cloud, so check each script for documentation.

# Assorted_Scripts
An assortment of small projects and simulations that I work on occasionally.

# Coupled Oscillators
A set of simple models and visualizations of coupled oscillators.
-  Kuramoto_1 uses the finite difference method to plot phase over time. Each point is an oscillator, the x-axis is the cosine of the phase, and the y-axis is the sine of the phase. I have mostly abandoned this approach.
-  Kuramoto_2 uses integration with scipy to plot phase over time. Each line is an oscillator, the x-axis is time, and the y-axis is phase mod 2Ï€. I'm struggling to remove the vertical lines associated with the modulo, so I have mostly abandoned this approach.
-  Kuramoto_3 is similar to Kuramoto_2 but plots the phase similarly to Kuramoto_1. I have mostly abandoned this approach.
-  Kuramoto_4 experiments with the evolution of phase and magnitude. Each point is an oscillator in a typical polar coordinate system. This is my most recent work.

# Cubefield Custom
A simple game where the player avoids oncoming objects.

# Density of Primes
A simple script for visualizing the distribution of prime numbers within the set of natural numbers.

# Evolution Roguelike
A custom roguelike game that I work on occasionally. It is a mix of original and borrowed code that will be credited soon. For now, it's just a foundation from which I aim to build upon.

# Rotating Frame NMR
A simple attempt at visualizing the rotating frame in nuclear magnetic resonance. It is far from complete, but the basic mechanics are there in terms of visualization.
